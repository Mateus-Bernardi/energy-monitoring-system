# Electrical Energy Consumption Monitoring and Control System

Simulation of an energy monitoring system using the PIC18F4550

The proposed system consists of a set of components that work together to collect energy consumption data, process it, present it to the user, and enable consumption monitoring. In this 
project, current and voltage sensors were adapted so that a potentiometer can simulate these quantities, ensuring the project functions correctly and closely mimics real-world conditions.
